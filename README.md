# CAFB Post Sales-Delivery Data Analysis

## Overview:
We have been given a sample data and being asked to pull some meaningful insights out of it using Tableau/Excel. We have used Tableau to make these visualizations.

## Audience:
The audience for the report is Food Bank staff, responsible for overseeing the distribution of product across our service area.

## Data Source:
The data is captured by CAFB's ERP system. The data is generated when product is distributed on Sales Orders out of our warehouses and sent to partner agencies located across our service area.

## Assumptions:
1. The pulled insights are only for reporting purposes. We have not identified/highlighted any business issues in this analysis.

1. There's lot more that could be done with the data but since we do not know what question to answer, our **approach had been very general**.

1. We found the recorded CAFB cost of certain deliveries were not mnetioned in the data files. And we did not clean up or transformed the data to make the legitmate indications.

1. We have tried to keep the visualization fairly easy to understand except the last one that we couldn't resist putting through as it, in our opinion, presented more meaningful information.

1. Our filters are all tied up and fairly easy to use.

## Analysis:
1. Deliveries: We made 268,177 deliveries in total, out of which 76,216 were pickups, 1471 were external deliveries, 160,094 were traditional deliveries, and for the remainder of 30,396 deliveries we have no information.

1. We had total of 13,275 orders in the DC region, 26,752 orders in MD region, and VA region took the lead in making remarkable 29,735 deliveries.

1. Warehouse #2 made the maximum deliveries across all the three regions. The next highest deliveries were made by warehouse #5, followed by warehouse #1 with some resaonable no of deliveries in VA region. The remaining warehouses were that busy.

1. As expected we delivered maximum dry food items, followed by the Referegerated items, and we delivered the frozen products the least in all the regions.

1. We delivered majorly wellness food. A small percentage was non-wellness and a small percentage was unidentified. We also delivered some non-food items.

1. Lastly, we put together the area graph to illustrate the estimated cost of food by item. **NOTE:** We mentioned "estimated cost" because of the missing data elements.

## Conclusion:
We enjoyed doing this analysis and would be happy to discuss further with the stakholders for their specific needs.
